# About Me

Hi, my name is Sam Blumenthal, and I'm a software engineer fresh out of Georgia Tech, where earned a degree in Computer Science with a focus in Modelling & Simulation and Intelligence. I am a fan of Lisp and other functional languages and (never actually) write about my experiences with them.
