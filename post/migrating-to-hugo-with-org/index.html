  <p>I have recently moved over my blog from Jekyll to Hugo. I can&rsquo;t really say I have a great reason for doing so, but as this blog has no traffic and only one post, I figured I had nothing to lose from doing so. That being said, I found myself not liking my defaults on Jekyll while also feeling unfamiliar with it&rsquo;s layout, structure and ruby internals so that I didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable changing things.</p>

<p>While Hugo doesn&rsquo;t offer me any advantages in these regards, it does seem to have great 3rd party emacs org support through <a href="https:github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo#installation">ox-hugo</a> which allows me to create all my posts as one org-mode file and publish them separately. Honestly, I was initially looking for a direct org &rarr; static site solution, but upon being unable to find anything that fit my needs, I stumbled upon <code>ox-hugo</code> and it seems to fulfill all my requirements.</p>
