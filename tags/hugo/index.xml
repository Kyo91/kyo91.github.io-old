      <description>I have recently moved over my blog from Jekyll to Hugo. I can&amp;rsquo;t really say I have a great reason for doing so, but as this blog has no traffic and only one post, I figured I had nothing to lose from doing so. That being said, I found myself not liking my defaults on Jekyll while also feeling unfamiliar with it&amp;rsquo;s layout, structure and ruby internals so that I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel comfortable changing things.</description>
