      <description>Hi, my name is Sam Blumenthal, and I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer fresh out of Georgia Tech, where earned a degree in Computer Science with a focus in Modelling &amp;amp; Simulation and Intelligence. I am a fan of Lisp and other functional languages and (never actually) write about my experiences with them.</description>

      <title>Elasticsearch Requests from Emacs</title>

      <description>Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself working with Elasticsearch&amp;rsquo;s JSON API and being disappointed with the state of api request tools. While many offer some neat functionalities, none of them are as easy to navigate as Emacs. Additionally, all I&amp;rsquo;ve seen require typing into different text fields for say the URL resource versus the body text (on that note many clients seem to have limited support for bodies on a GET request, albeit I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen an API besides ES&amp;rsquo;s to use that feature).</description>
